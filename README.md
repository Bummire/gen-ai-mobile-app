# Streamlit Setup Instructions (Preferred for Project Members)
#As a team we have decided to use their built in codespace for ease of use, access [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) here. 

1. Create an account or Sign in

   ```
   You can create an account using the link provided above!
   ```
   
2. Ensure you have a GitHub account linked to your Streamlit account.
   
   ```
   When logged in, navigate to the top left where your username is, click on it to access the
   drop down menu. Next, click on settings and a screen will appear. Ensure the tab
   "Linked accounts" is selected, from here you should be able to link your GitHub account.
   ```
   If you do not have an account, use this link [Github](https://github.com/) or when redirected by Streamlit when linking an 
   account.

3. Contact Project Leader

   ```
   Once linked, you will need to contact the Project Leader, so they can invite you to the GitHub
   Repository, which will automatically allow you to gain access to the Streamlit app project.
   ```
 
# Installation Guide (Optional for Project Members, Requirement for Stakeholders)
 You are not required to install streamlit, but you can if you decide to. Follow the instructions below to do so.

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

 
# How to Start Coding
1. Locating the project within Streamlit

   ```
   When on the homepage of Streamlit, navigate to the top left corner where your username
   and icon are located. Once clicked on, you should be able to select between projects.
   Ensure you switch it to "Bummire Apps", once selected your homepage will update and you
   will be able to see "gen-ai-mobile-app ∙ main ∙ streamlit_app.py" under "bummire's apps"
   ```

2. Coding using Codespaces

   ```
   To start coding, you will need to navigate and click on the three vertical dots located on
   the far right side of the app called "gen-ai-mobile-app ∙ main ∙ streamlit_app.py". Once
   clicked, you will be able to click on "Edit in Codespaces". Depending on how fast your
   internet is, the time for this to load my vary. From here you will be able to see two screens,
   the left side is where you will code and the right side, can be refreshed when changes are made
   to see what you have done.
   ```

3. Saving your code

   ```
   To save your code, you will need to open up the GitHub Repository. From here you will need to
   click on the file within the main page called "streamlit_app.py". Navigate to the top left above
   the code on Github, to the edit button (pencil icon). Now copy your entire code from Streamlit
   and replace the current code on Github. Once ready, you can press commit changes, in extended
   description, you include the changes you made so others are aware on what is changed.
   ```

# How to Run the App
1. Starting the App

   ```
   When on the homepage, after "bummire's apps" is selected (steps can be found under "How to Start
   Coding"), click on the app name and a new browser will be opened displaying the created app.
   ```

2. Troubleshooting

   ```
   If you open up the app and wonder why your changes haven't been converted over, you will need to
   navigate back to the homepage where the three dots are located alongside your app. From here, you
   can click on Reboot, which will refresh everything allowing changes to appear on the app. Note:
   before you do this, ensure you let anyone know of this to ensure changes aren't lost if multiple
   people are working on the app at once. As doing this may refresh their code potentially losing
   time spent.
   ```
